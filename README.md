# Analysing-Rental-Reviews

Australia is experiencing a housing crisis, with property prices rising three times faster than household income since June 2020.
In 2023, TikToker Jordie created a public Twitter database to expose substandard rental properties with increasing prices.

The database allows renters to review their properties or agencies, serving as “rental cops” to raise awareness about rental quality.

The report focuses on understanding the factors that drive perceived rental quality in three Sydney suburbs.

- Poor rental housing quality is associated with mental health issues; mold and dampness are reported 10% more often by renters than homeowners (CEDA, 2023).
- The study aims to classify rental property quality (low to high) and identify factors that influence these ratings.
- Insights from this research could help renters make better-informed decisions and hold landlords accountable for living conditions.
